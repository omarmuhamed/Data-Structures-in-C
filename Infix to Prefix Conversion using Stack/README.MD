# Infix to Prefix Conversion using Stack
**Infix: The expression in which the operator is between the operands. (A + B)**

**Prefix: The expression in which the operator comes before every pair of operands (+AB)**
### Why we need to convert Infix to Prefix? 
**Evaluating Infix expressions is not efficient as the computer has to do repeated scans to differentiate and evaluate the operators and parenthesis unlike the Prefix expressions in which there are no parenthesis**
